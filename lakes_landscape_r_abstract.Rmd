## Abstract

In the last several years scientific reproducibility has been a hot topic with 
several fields openly struggling with reproducing and replicating research 
results.  One of the key tools to address reproducibility is the use of open 
source software.  Increasingly in ecology, the R langauge for statistical 
computing is the open source software of choice for analysis and programming 
tasks.  Our research group has also made the choice to invest in the use of R 
for our work.  In this poster we share examples of how we use R to help build an
open foundation for our work on understanding how water quality, landscapes, and 
limnological processes interact to control cyanobacteria blooms. In particular 
we discuss three R packages - `lakemorpho`, `elevatr`, and `goatscape` - that 
we have developed to facilitate our research. The `lakemorpho` package provides
the ability to more easily reproduce calculation of lake morphometry metrics.
One of the data requirements for `lakemorpho` is access to elevation data. In 
response to this need, we developed `elevatr` to provide access to digital 
elevation models and point elevation estimates for anywhere in the world. 
Lastly, we are developing `goatscape` to provide the ability to reproducibly 
summarize key landscape metrics within an input landscape polygon. We will 
illustrate the use of these packages with examples form our own research on 
landscape and water quality drivers of cyanobacteria. While these tools have 
direct applications to landscape and limnological research, they are more 
broadly concevied such that they can benefit the larger landscape ecology 
community and help facilitate openness and reproducibility of a variety of 
landscape ecological research efforts.
